# Typography

Here are all the typography tokens we extended from the Tailwind base theme.

To use them, combine with the proper Tailwind class.

For example, to change the font size to `fontSize.2xs`, apply the `.text-2xs` class.

## Font Sizes

- `fontSize.2xs`: **0.625rem** - _10px_;

For more information about font sizes, please refer to the Tailwind [typography](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/font-family) page.
